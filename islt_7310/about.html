<h1>Ashney Randle</h1>
<h3>Archive Technician</h3>
<p>I am a committed, diligent, and reliable individual who strives to find ways to improve her workplace for the sake of staff and customers. Currently working as an Archives Technician for the <em>National Archives at St. Louis</em>. In 2013, she graduated from Missouri State University with a Bachelor of Arts in History with a minor in Library Science. In the summer of 2015, I completed an internship at the <em>Eisenhower Presidential Library</em>, where I processed and helped create a finding aid for photographs of Jacqueline Cochran. </br>I intend to graduate with my Masters of Library and Information Science (MLIS) degree from the University of Missouri in May 2021. While in the program, I have developed an interest in library and archives management, and want to find ways to improve library work processes in order to better serve patrons while helping staff work more effectively with less resources.</p>
