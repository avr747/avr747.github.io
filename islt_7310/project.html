        <p>The MLIS program at the University of Missouri has four Student Learning Outcomes (SLO's) that graduate students need to meet in 
            order to graduate. Below you will find a brief description of each project and links to view them on this page. At the end is a chart
          that lists each SLO, their goals, and a link to view each project on its own page.</p>

          <h2 id="SLO1">SLO 1: Foundations</h3>
            <p>The project I chose to demonstrate my understanding of this SLO is an advocacy letter I wrote to Congressman William Lacy Clay. This letter was written as the final project for the “Foundations of Library and Information Science” completed in the 
                        Fall of 2018. After learning about the ethics of librarianship and the importance of advocacy, we were instructed to write a letter in 
                        order to persuade an individual or group into supporting an issue we found in the field. I chose to write a letter in the hopes of 
                        convincing a Congressman to help secure more funding for the National Personnel Records Center in orde to purchase 
                        the necessary technology to help modernize and improve our services to US veterans and their families</p>

          <h2 id="SLO2">SLO 2: Management</h3>
            <p> I chose my IDPF Digitization project to represent this SLO. Consisteing of several parts, I chose to share the <em>Project Description</em> and <em>Work Breakdown Structure</em> (WBS) in 
                        order to demonstrate mastery of this SLO. The <em>Project Description</em> provides an explanation for why the project was being done 
                        and the benefit of this project to the institution. While the WBS shows how I was able to breakdown the work into manageable parts that can later 
                        be assigned to involved staff and stakeholders to implement. This project taught me how to keep track and manage tasks, and helped me develop
                        skills that are valuable in being in able to collaborate and work effectively with others in achieving organization goals.</p>

          <h2 id="SLO3">SLO 3: Technology</h3>
            <p> For this SLO, I chose an assignment from my Archival Appraisal & Systems course. I was tasked with creating a finding aid for an unprocessed or partially processed collection, and in doing so 
                        learned about the challenges of making information available online. There are plenty of technical aspects information professionals 
                        must think of when making sure collections are accessible, such as making sure previous finding aids transferred over to a new system 
                        are able to be converted to a new program. I provided the VoiceThread presenation I did for this project, 
                        which better summarizes my experiences in working with a collection and building a finding aid using ArchivesSpace.</p>

          <h2 id="SLO4">SLO 4: Access, Use, & Users</h3>
            <p> The project I chose for this SLO is my American Folklore LibGuide. I decided to compile print and electronic resources that would be useful to 
                        university students and faculty in studying American Folklore. I learned how to find relevant information for a specific 
                        audience, and how a LibGuide can be utilized as an instructional tool. Not all databases or online catalogs are the exact 
                        same, so creating videos explaining how to use an uncommon resource to patrons helps teach users how to find their desired 
                        information and improve information literacy skills.</p>
