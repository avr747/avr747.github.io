        <h2>My Journey in the MLIS Program</h2>
        <p>When I first entered the MLIS program, my focus was on learning everything I could about the profession and what it means to be an 
            LIS professional. The Foundations to Library and Information Science course I feel provided me with the base understanding that an 
            LIS professional is more than just a librarian, but an advocate for intellectual freedom. Seeing how the field has changed over the
            years helped me to better understand why advocacy for the profession is a necessary responsibility of all LIS professionals in the 
            field, and I felt motivated to do my part to learn all I could to better my own workplace. Classes like Introduction to 
            Information Technology, Organization of Information, Reference Sources and Services, Collection and Access Management, and 
            Management of Information Agencies also helped to inform my understand of the tools we use and the policies we put in place to operate
            as information centers for the public.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In my second year in the program, while in my Management of Information Agencies and American Library History courses is where I felt my
            interest in library and archives management started to form. In learning about the history of how libraries developed in the United 
            States, I was able to develop an appreciation and understanding of how far the field has come and the potential in where we could go. 
            The Management of Information Agencies course, taught me more about the challenges in regards to leadership. From personnel to facility 
            management, I learned so much about the responsibilities of those in management positions, and came away to better empathize with my own
            supervisor and the work he does for us in my current position. My desire to learn more about management is why I took courses in project 
            management and information policy. Developing skills to help manage collaborative projects, and developing an awareness of the world and 
            the laws we operate in are important for an information agency to succeed today.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the later half of my second year and my third, I focused on taking archival science courses in order to understand archival theory. 
            After my internship with the Eisenhower Presidential Library, I found that I wanted to be an Archivist and knew I needed to study 
            archival theory in order to succeed in the field. The courses I took were relevant to my current work as an Archives Technician, but 
            I came to understand what the values and ethics are for archivists, where the field is and where it desires to go, and what my place 
            in it is. While I do not see myself becoming an Archivist now, having a full understanding of the responsibilities of archivists and 
            the tools they need to do their work, helps me in finding ways to help them get what they need to do their job.</p> 
        <br>    
        <p>As I reach the end of my time in the MLIS program, I have a strong appreciation for the work LIS professionals do. Advocacy and ensuring
            the public’s right to intellectual freedom is protected is important, but what I’m walking away with is an even stronger desire to help
            LIS professionals do the work they need live up to the mission of their institutions. I’ve met professors, co-workers, and even mentors 
            who have so much passion for their work. Their enthusiasm and love for the field continues to inspire me to do my best.
