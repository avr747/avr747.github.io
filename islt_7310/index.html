        <h3>Welcome! I am current Masters of Library and Information Science graduate student at the University of Missouri, and 
            my goal is to one day obtain a position where I get to manage and improve internal processes of libraries and archives.</h3>
        <p>When I entered the MLIS program in 2018, my goal was to learn more about the LIS profession. I came into the program with a 
            lot of technical experience, but little knowledge of how the field worked. I feel that lacking a sense of what being an 
            LIS professional is hinders my growth. Upon graduation in May 2021, I will be leaving the MLIS profession with the 
            knowledge of what the core ethics of librarianship are, and the role I play as an LIS professional. With this portfolio, 
            it is my hope that I am able to demonstrate two things. The first, is that you can see my what my interests are and my growth
             as a professional. Second, is to highlight the work I have done in the MLIS program. 
             The work selected is what I feel demonstrates my mastery of the four student learning outcomes of the program.</p>
