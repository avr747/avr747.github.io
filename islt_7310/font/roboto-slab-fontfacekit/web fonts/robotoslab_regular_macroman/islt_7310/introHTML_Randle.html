Hello! My name is Ashney Randle, and I live in St. Louis, Missouri. In 2013, I received a BA in History from Missouri State University, and I will be graduating with a MLIS degree this semester! Currently, I work as an Archives Technician at the National Personnel Records Center. In high school, I took a web design course where we got to work with Dreamweaver and I remember learning some basic HTML in elementary school. My hope for this course is that Iâ€™m able to refresh my mind on some of the stuff I previously remember learning, and learn new skills that will one day help me in my work.  My hobbies are playing video games and watching shows on Netflix (currently watching old anime I watched as a kid). I used to teach myself how to do video editing tricks, and plan to pick it up again upon graduating.
